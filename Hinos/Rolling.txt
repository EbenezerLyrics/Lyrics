I′m not known for being this naughty
What you wanna do with my body?
Play me like a brand-new Atari
Smokin' trees, I don′t need Ferrari

I've been rollin' all my life, I′m doin′ on my way
I've been shakin′, shakin', shakin′
I've been makin′ waves
I've been changin' all the game, I mean the tin will shake
The highest price you pay is the hardest part to play

Rollin′
Makin′ some green and I show it
So when you see me, you'll know it
Flamin′ on my own emotions
Emotions

New hair, new bag
New weave, stay mad
New things, who's that?
Straight up, just facts
New beef, the D
She′s that, just gag
New this, new that
Are you this? Are you that?
New this, new that
Are you this? Are you that?

I've been rollin′ all my life, I'm doin' on my way

I've been makin′ waves
I've been changin′ all the game, I mean the tin will shake
The highest price you pay is the hardest part to play

Rollin'
Rollin' (new hair)
Makin′ some green and I show it (new bag)
So when you see me, you′ll know it
Flamin' on my own emotions
Emotions

Straight up, just facts
New beef, the D
She that, just gag
New this, new that
Are you this? Are you?
