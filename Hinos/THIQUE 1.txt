Cash gettin′ bigger
Racks gettin' bigger
Cash gettin′ larger
He thought he was loving me good, I told him, "Go harder"
She thought she was killing that, I told her, "Go harder"
Just look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water
Racks gettin' thiquer
Cash getting thiquer

That′s that thique, that′s that real thique
That's that jelly, baby, champagne and cherry, baby
That′s that thique, that's that ball drop
That′s that keep going, that's that never stop

That′s that thique, that's that na-na, that oochy coochy, la, la
Yeah, this that Fiji agua, candy girl, piñata
Hit it in the car and take you back to the casa
Bet I got you rock now, that thique all over that yacht, now
Uh, that's that Freaknik, that′s that 1996
That′s that moon Miami bass, 12 in the trunk, 808
Uh, that's that Castro, eat that thick like Mastro′s
She say she on a diet, girl, you better not lose that, though

That's that thique, that′s that real thique
That's that jelly, baby
That′s that really, baby
That's that thique, that's that ball drop
That′s that keep going, that′s that never stop

Baby, that's that thique
That′s that thique
Baby, that's that thique
That′s that thique
Look at this sh-

Ooh, that's that strawberry, that′s that grape and cherry
This that Ginsu, cut that b- like culinary
Ooh, that's that bounce, spend my money, make it count
If it's lost then it get found
Just keep dropping that sh- down

That′s that summer
That′s them Hummers
That's that girl, give me your number
That′s that Jordy
That's that Scarlett
That I just got out of college
That′s that I don't do this usually
I don′t know what you do to me
That I don't do this usually
I don't know what you do to me

Boy you crazy, body mean
Back it up like limousine
They got to make a fold out to fit in magazine, right
Girl, look at your body, right
Boy, take this in slow, don′t let go
Tell me how bad you been wanting it
And hurry up, quick, ′fore the moment ends
I like what I hear, might be sleeping in
Screaming, "Beyoncé, chocolate ounces, sit on that, bounce it, bounce it"
